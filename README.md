# Road Accident Analysis - Interactive Excel Dashboard

This project demonstrates the process of designing and developing a **dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard** from start to finish. The project addresses a real-world business problem involving **road accidents**, with data sourced from a demo dataset on Kaggle. 

## Key Concepts and Skills Covered

### Dashboard Features
- **Slicers & Filters**: Dynamically filter data (e.g., rural vs. urban areas) to update charts.
- **Interactive Charts**: Charts such as line graphs, donut charts, bar graphs update based on the selected filters.
- **Timeline Filter**: Analyze road accidents by different time periods, such as year and month.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning**: Formatting the dataset, handling missing values, fixing errors (e.g., spelling mistakes).
2. **Data Processing**: Creating calculated columns, such as extracting months and years from dates.
3. **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to create visualizations like bar graphs, pie charts, and tree maps.
4. **Report Building**: Creating an aggregated interactive dashboard that provides insights into the dataset.

### Business Problem Solving
- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**: Visualize important metrics such as total casualties, accident severity, and vehicle types involved in accidents.
- **Monthly Trends**: Analyze current year vs. previous year's casualties using line charts for comparison.

## Skills Developed
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling large datasets, fixing inconsistencies, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Data Processing**: Creating custom columns and using Excel functions like `TEXT` for extracting relevant data.
- **Data Visualization**: Building interactive and dynamic visualizations with Excel PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Slicers.
- **Dashboard Development**: Organizing KPIs and using slicers and filters to make data more user-friendly and interactive.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Excel PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Slicers**: For data summarization and visualization.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Line charts, bar charts, tree maps, donut charts, and more.
- **Excel Formulas & Functions**: Using functions for aggregation, data cleaning, and creating custom columns.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Download the Excel file from [this link]([your_project_link_here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eYltm2-8t8V83rEtvKRH0AnPBY7Hr7eG?usp=sharing)).
2. Open the file in Microsoft Excel.
3. Use slicers to filter data by area type (rural vs. urban), year, month, etc., and watch the charts dynamically update.
4. Explore the dashboard to analyze road accident data and trends over time.
